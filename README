USER INFO:
Trace examines .pcap files and prints out useful data found inside the pcap
file. This is done by reading in the next packet and extracting the information
from the relevant headers, as well as the data within. 

This was created in a virtual Ubuntu x86 environment, and is not intended
to run outside of a unix-based system.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The provided makefile creates trace with a suffix describing the OS the program
was built on. 

The program expects to be run with one argument, the name of the pcap file to
inspect.

The program will print out usage on an incorrect call. 

OTHER THOUGHTS:
I'm not particularly happy with my implementation of this. If I could do it
over, I would get all the headers in one spot and then print everything out.
This would save calls to malloc and free as well, which is my main reason
for wanting to do this over.
